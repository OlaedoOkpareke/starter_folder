Abstract:

Housing maintenance beneifts residents as it ensures proper functioning of ammenities, maintains structural integrity, and adds value to homes. However, previous research has found that priority in maintenance for public housing apartments and lower income apartments is little compared to their more privileged counterparts. We use data from Open data Toronto to further analyze this by using plots and tables to break down apartment scores and other attributes by Ward and apartment type, using R (R Core Team 2021) and other packages. We find that apartments in higher income areas and privately owned apartments tend to have better evaluation scores than those in lower income wards and public housing respectively. This data shows the inequality in standards for housing in Toronto, as well as the need for better government accountability and housing justice. Improving the gap in aparment quality helps improve the life of poor and marginalized people.
