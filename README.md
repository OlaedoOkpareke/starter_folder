This repository can be found at https://github.com/OlaedoOkpareke/starter_folder.

First run the rscript file, this creates the dataset.  Then run the bib file for references and citations, then run the rmd file.

The repository is organised as follows:

The outputs folder: 

The .bib file contains the citations for the raw data, packages and literature used in the report.

The rmd file contains the analysis report on Toronto apartment evaluation scores, as well as the code used to create the report. This code was mainly used to create tables and graphs.

The pdf file contains the same analysis report but in pdf form, and without the code.

Inputs folder:

The csv file contains the dataset. 

Scripts folder:

The r script contains code for downloading and cleaning the raw data.

Abstract:

Housing maintenance beneifts residents as it ensures proper functioning of ammenities, maintains structural integrity, and adds value to homes. However, previous research has found that priority in maintenance for public housing apartments and lower income apartments is little compared to their more privileged counterparts. We use data from Open data Toronto to further analyze this by using plots and tables to break down apartment scores and other attributes by Ward and apartment type, using R (R Core Team 2021) and other packages. We find that apartments in higher income areas and privately owned apartments tend to have better evaluation scores than those in lower income wards and public housing respectively. This data shows the inequality in standards for housing in Toronto, as well as the need for better government accountability and housing justice. Improving the gap in aparment quality helps improve the life of poor and marginalized people.
